The project demonstrates the effectiveness of combining SVM classification and 3D-CNN for accurate lung cancer detection using CT images. The 3D-CNN extracts detailed volumetric features, while the SVM ensures robust classification of malignant and benign nodules. 
This hybrid approach enhances detection accuracy, making it a reliable solution for early diagnosis. The systemâ€™s scalability and efficiency position it as a valuable tool in medical imaging. 
With future enhancements like personalized treatment predictions and explainable AI, it can evolve into a comprehensive platform for cancer diagnosis and management, improving patient outcomes and survival rates.
A potential future enhancement for the detection of lung cancer using CT images with SVM classification and 3D-CNN is the integration of personalized treatment prediction and monitoring systems.
By combining deep learning with predictive analytics, the model could not only detect cancer but also analyse patient-specific factors such as tumour growth patterns, genetic markers, and treatment responses. 
Incorporating longitudinal data and electronic health records (EHRs) into the system would allow it to predict survival rates and recommend tailored treatment strategies.
Moreover, integrating explainable AI (XAI) techniques could make the predictions more interpretable for medical professionals, fostering trust and aiding in critical decision-making.
This enhancement would transform the system from a diagnostic tool into a comprehensive cancer management platform.
